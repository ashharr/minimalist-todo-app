## **Introduction**

The Minimalist Todo app is a simple yet powerful task management application built using the Spring framework. It allows users to create, update, and manage their tasks effectively. The application utilizes Spring Boot to simplify the setup and configuration process, Hibernate for data persistence, and Spring Security for authentication and authorization.

## **Installation**

To install the Minimalist Todo app, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository: **`git clone <repository-url>`**
3. Navigate to the project directory: **`cd minimalist-todo-app`**
4. Build the project using Maven: **`mvn clean install`**

## **Configuration**

Before running the application, you need to configure the following:

1. **Database Configuration**: Open the **`application.properties`** file located in the `**src/main/resources/application.properties**` directory. Update the database connection properties to match your local database configuration. I am making use of the MySQL database for this project. You can use that or in memory database such as H2. 
2. **Security Configuration**: Open the **`SecurityConfig.java`** file located in the `**src/main/java/com/mytodoapp/springboot/mytodoapp/security/SpringSecurityConfiguration.java**` directory. Customize the security configurations such as authentication providers, access control rules, etc., according to your requirements.

## **Usage**

To run the Minimalist Todo app, execute the following command:

```bash
java -jar target/minimalist-todo-app.jar
```

Once the application is up and running, you can access it by navigating to **`http://localhost:8089`** in your web browser.

After you enter the credentials you would see the Home page.
